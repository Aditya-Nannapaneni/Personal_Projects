# Building Energy Score Prediction

## Quick Introduction

In this project we are given a dataset containing both numerical and categorical features pertaining to buildings in New York City and we have to come up with a model that can predict a building's Energy Star Score (real valued target variable) 

### Examples of Numerical Features:

    - Gross Floor Area
    - Year Built
    - Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)
    - Weather Normalized Site EUI (kBtu/ft²)
    - District Steam Use (kBtu)
### Examples of Categorical Features:
    - Property Name
    - Street Address
    - Borough
    - Primary Property Type (ex: Office, Hospital e.t.c)


## Problem Statement

Use the provided building energy data to develop a model that can predict a building's Energy Star score, and then interpret the results to find the variables that are most predictive of the score.
